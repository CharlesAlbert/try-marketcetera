== Try Marketcetera

It comes from and idea I develop on Rails Rumble 2012 (github.com/churumelas), now I'm trying to join my rumble idea with great experiences I've been learning while working with marketcetera platform.

My initial plans is create a kind of easy/medium/hard challenges hacking the platform step by step as I did while facing my development tasks working for my customers.

If you wanna to contribute, let'me know! I wanna translate it to other languages too.
